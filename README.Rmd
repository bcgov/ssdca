`ssdtools` is an R package to plot and fit Species Sensitivity Distributions (SSD). 

SSDs are cumulative probability distributions which are fitted to toxicity concentrations for different species as described by Posthuma et al. (2001).
The ssdtools package uses Maximum Likelihood to fit distributions such as the log-normal, gamma, log-logistic, log-Gumbel, Gompertz and Weibull.
The user can also provide custom distributions.
Multiple distributions can be averaged using Information Criteria.
Confidence intervals on hazard concentrations and proportions are produced by parametric bootstrapping.

## Installation

To install the latest version from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ssdtools)
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("ssdtools")
```

To install the latest development version:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bcgov/ssdtools")
```

## Introduction

`ssdtools` provides a data set for several chemicals including Boron.
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(ssdtools)
boron_data
```

Multiple distributions can be fit using `ssd_fit_dists()`
```{r, eval = FALSE}
boron_dists <- ssd_fit_dists(boron_data)
```

and plot using the `ggplot2` generic `autoplot`
```{r, warning = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_bw())
autoplot(boron_dists)
```

The goodness of fit can be assessed using `ssd_gof`
```{r, warning = FALSE}
ssd_gof(boron_dists)
```

and the model-averaged 5% hazard concentration estimated using `ssd_hc`
```{r, eval = FALSE}
set.seed(99)
boron_hc5 <- ssd_hc(boron_dists, ci = TRUE)
```

```{r}
print(boron_hc5)
```

Model-averaged predictions complete with confidence intervals can be produced using the `stats` generic `predict`
```{r, eval=FALSE}
set.seed(99)
boron_pred <- predict(boron_dists, ci = TRUE)
```

and plotted together with the original data using `ssd_plot`.
```{r}
ssd_plot(boron_data, boron_pred,
  shape = "Group", color = "Group", label = "Species",
  xlab = "Concentration (mg/L)", ribbon = TRUE
) + expand_limits(x = 3000)
```

A shiny webpage developed for non-R-users is available at <https://bcgov-env.shinyapps.io/ssdtools>.

The ssdtools package was developed as a result of earlier drafts of:

The CCME `data.csv` data file is derived from a factsheet prepared by the [Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment](http://ceqg-rcqe.ccme.ca/en/index.html). See the [`data-raw`](https://github.com/bcgov/ssdtools/tree/master/data-raw) folder for more information.
